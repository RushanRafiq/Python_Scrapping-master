Tag String: ADELAIDE: England were staring down the barrel of another sorry defeat on Saturday, dismissed for 236 then forced to watch as Australia batted again and stretched their lead in the day-night second Ashes Test in Adelaide. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Joe Root and Dawid Malan had survived the opening session of day three unscathed, building a 128-run stand as they chased Australia’s imposing first-innings 473 for nine declared. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: But it all came crashing down after the dinner break with both players removed in quick succession, Root for 62 and Malan for 80, sparking a collapse that saw England slump from 150 for two to 236 all out. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Making matters worse, they did so against a second-string attack with Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood both missing. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Stand-in Australian skipper Steve Smith could have enforced the follow-on, but chose to rest his bowlers and send in the openers to turn the screw with two days left. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: They negotiated some 75 minutes for the loss of David Warner for 13, needlessly run out after a disastrous mix-up with Marcus Harris, who remains unbeaten on 21. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Nightwatchman Michael Neser was on two as Australia reached 45 for one, building their lead to 282. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Hostile pace from Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon’s dangerous spin did the damage to England, complemented by Cameron Green, who bagged Root for the second consecutive time. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Starc claimed 4-37 and Lyon 3-58. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: No bowler enjoys using the pink ball as much as the left-armer Starc. His record now  stands at 50 wickets 18 ahead of next-best Josh Hazlewood at an average  of 18.10 in day-night Tests. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “We’ve got a bit of a luxury of having  played eight Tests and [six] have been here,” Starc said. “I don’t think  Ive nailed it. But we’ve all got a certain plan to it.”  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Malan said Root and himself should have carried on. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “It’s pretty frustrating and disappointing — to lose two wickets like we did on Friday night, then get ourselves back into a position where we could get within touching distance of them,” said Malan. “Ultimately Rooty or myself should have gone on and got a big hundred.” 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: England crashed by nine wickets in the first Test at Brisbane and if they go 2-0 down in Adelaide the Ashes are as good as gone, needing to win all three remaining Tests. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Australia bowled repeat maidens at the start of the second session and Root looked increasingly uncomfortable against Green, who was starting to find movement with the pink ball. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Having passed 1,600 Test runs in a calendar year — only the fourth player in history to do so — Root poked at a Green delivery and got an edge to Smith at slip, leaving him still searching for an elusive first-ever century in Australia. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Malan soon followed, slashing at a Starc thunderbolt that took a nick, again into Smith’s safe hands. Malan has now scored nine Test 50s but only converted one into a century. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “We let it meander a little bit through the first session,” Starc said, while heaping praise on all-rounder Green. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “He’s a serious talent for a young kid, he’s a great addition to our bowling attack, he was extremely good in that session after the break.” 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Starc added:  “We hold all the cards in terms of when we want to bowl and how big a lead we want to have, we’ve certainly got a few options on the table.” 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Like in Brisbane, England’s batting folded. Ollie Pope survived a bat-pad review but only lasted two more balls, charging down the wicket to Lyon and edging to Marnus Labuschagne at short leg on five. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Jos Buttler fell without scoring to Starc and England trudged off to tea on 197 for six. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: It didn’t take long for Australia to clean up the rest with Chris Woakes and Ollie Robinson also undone by Lyon, and when Ben Stokes was bowled by Green for 34, it was all but over. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: England had resumed at 17 for two after losing openers Rory Burns (four) and Haseeb Hameed (six) to a fiery 40-minute spell from Starc, Neser and Jhye Richardson under lights on Friday evening. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Root strode out on five, alongside Malan on one. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: They had perfect early batting conditions on a flat Adelaide pitch and Root settled, slamming a well-timed drive for four to boost his confidence. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Starc was hit for 11 off his first over and the pair quickly brought up their 50 partnership. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Malan completed his 50 with a single off Neser, while Root hit Richardson to the boundary to reach his 52nd half-century.

Tag String: LAHORE: Rana Abdul Waheed scored twice, including a 57th-minute leveller, to help Pakistan hold South Korea to a 3-3 draw in their round-robin match of the Asian Champions Trophy in Dhaka, Bangladesh on Saturday.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Man-of-the-match Afraz’s 24th-minute goal cancelled out Kim Kyu-beom’s opener for South Korea 10 minutes earlier before Wahid put Pakistan in front in the 33rd.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The Koreans, however, regained the lead with goals by Ji Woo-Cheon in the 42nd and Jang Jong-hyun in the 56th, only for Wahid to secure a point for Pakistan.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Without a win in their first three matches, Pakistan remain fourth in the standings and in the final semi-final spot with two points, ahead of pointless Bangladesh, who are in fifth and were hammered 5-0 by Japan in the day’s other game.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Pakistan face Bangladesh in the final round of games on Sunday and a draw will be enough to secure a semi-final berth.   
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: India, who have seven points, will finish top of the league standings regardless of the result against third-placed Japan in Sunday’s other match.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Japan are only ahead of Pakistan on goal difference and results in the final round could see Pakistan finish in third place.   
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: South Korea have already secured second place with six points from their four games.

Tag String: LONDON: The Premier League lost another match to a Covid-19 outbreak in a squad when Aston Villa’s home game against Burnley was postponed around two hours before kickoff on Saturday. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Villa said it did not have enough players to field a team following more positive tests in its squad that were reported early Saturday. The league approved Villa’s request to postpone the match based on the number of Covid-19 cases, injuries and illness.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “After reviewing all the new information provided by Aston Villa this morning and receiving separate medical advice, the Board approved the request as a result of the club not having enough players to field a team,” the league said. “This decision was based on the number of Covid-19 cases, injuries and illness.”  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Neither the Premier League nor Villa provided details on how many players had tested positive.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “The results of PCR tests, which were taken yesterday prior to training as well as Lateral Flow Tests, were received this morning and confirmed further depletion of our playing squad which was already impacted upon for our trip to Norwich in midweek,” said Villa, who won that game 2-0.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “All individuals who tested positive are now isolating in line with Premier League and government guidance and protocols. The Club is extremely sorry for the inconvenience caused to Burnley Football Club, both our own supporters and the Burnley fans due to attend the fixture, but have acted as swiftly as possible this morning to minimise disruption.”  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Burnley had seen their home match against Watford on Wednesday called off at similar short notice after positive test results emerged in the visitors’ squad.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Tony Scholes, communication officer for Burnley FC Supporters Groups, one of hundreds of fans who had travelled to the game, questioned the lack of consideration for supporters.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “While aware of the current crisis, to have two games called off at such short notice within days of each other really is unacceptable. So many supporters are being inconvenienced without it seems any real concern from the clubs and the league,” he said.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Five matches scheduled for this weekend had already been called off because of coronavirus outbreaks in squads amid a worsening health emergency in Britain as the Omicron variant spreads.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The league said the remaining four games Leeds United-Arsenal on Saturday and Newcastle United-Manchester City, Wolverhampton Wanderers-Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur-Liverpool on Sunday are currently scheduled to proceed as planned.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The total number of Premier League games to have been postponed over the past week stands at 10. Only six games were called off in the whole of last season because of the coronavirus.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Premier League managers will meet on Monday to discuss the Covid-19 situation and what action to take, with a busy schedule of matches over the Christmas and New Year period.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Some managers have voiced concerns over potential harm to the integrity of the competition, with teams deprived of key players and some training grounds closed.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Brentford boss Thomas Frank this week called for a suspension of matches to “break the chain” of infection while Liverpool’s Jurgen Klopp said it could soon become impossible to maintain the schedule as squads became over-stretched by Covid absences and injuries.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The Premier League’s position has been that games will continue when it is safe to stage them.  
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The English Football League, which comprises the three divisions below the Premier League, has also been hit by a swathe of postponements with 19 of its 36 games called off due to coronavirus.

Tag String: ADELAIDE: England were battling to stay in the second Ashes Test on Friday after Australia removed both openers in a fiery spell under lights on day two to leave the visitors reeling. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The home team declared their first innings on a commanding 473 for nine at the Adelaide Oval, leaving England to face a trying 40 minutes against a swinging pink ball. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: They didn’t fare well with under-pressure Rory Burns lasting just three balls against a rampant Mitchell Starc, edging a rising delivery to Steve Smith at second slip after making just four. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Haseeb Hameed hung on slightly longer before Michael Neser, in for skipper Pat Cummins — who pulled out of the Test at the last minute over a Covid scare — bagged his maiden Test scalp. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Hameed, on six, chipped to Starc at mid-on with Neser mobbed by his team-mates. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Once again, England’s fate rests with skipper Joe Root, who was unbeaten on five alongside Dawid Malan on one as they reached stumps at 17 for two after lightning forced an early halt. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: England crashed by nine wickets in the first Test at Brisbane and if they go 2-0 down in Adelaide the Ashes are as good as gone, with Root’s men needing to win all three remaining Tests. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “It’s been a tough two days obviously, we’ve spent a lot of time out in the field,” said England all-rounder Ben Stokes. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “But we get to turn up tomorrow in the natural light [which] I think most people agree is the easiest and best time to be a batter out in the middle.” 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: He added:  “We don’t believe we’re beaten already.” 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Earlier, Marnus Labuschagne top-scored with a magnificent 103 while David Warner (95) and Smith (93) provided vital support after Australia resumed from their overnight 221-2. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Stokes was the pick of the England attack with 3-113, while Jimmy Anderson took 2-58. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Number three Labuschagne completed his epic century after setting himself up by batting almost all day on Thursday, bringing up his sixth Test ton and first in an Ashes series off a dogged 287 balls. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: But he struggled when Ollie Robinson was brought into the England attack and he was trapped lbw, adding just eight runs to his overnight 95. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “It was nice to get that hundred, obviously got a few chances there but that’s how it goes sometimes, you ride your luck,” Labuschagne said. “It feels like you have to grind for every run that you’re out there.” 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Labuschagne in the process also became the first player to hit three centuries in  day-night Test matches. Of the  3,068 players in Test cricket’s 144-year history, only Don Bradman,  George Headley, Herbert Sutcliffe and Mike Hussey have reached 2,000  runs faster than Labuschagne’s total in 34 innings. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Bradman achieved his 2,000 runs in 22 innings, Jamaican Headley in 32 and England’s Sutcliffe and Australia’s Hussey in 33. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Labuschagne  has now scored centuries in three consecutive day-night Tests at the  Adelaide Oval, averaging almost 100 and with just one score below 40. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Smith struck a fine 93 to help Australia reassert control after Travis Head and Cameron Green were out in quick succession after Labuschagne departed. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The stand-in captain was England’s key tormentor at the last Ashes in 2019, on his return from a ball-tampering ban, and he kept his cool in sweltering Adelaide. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: He was ably supported by Alex Carey, who is in the team as replacement wicket-keeper for former skipper Tim Paine, who quit on the eve of the Ashes over a text-message scandal. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Smith came to the crease when Warner was out and barely put a foot wrong, dishing out particular punishment to Chris Woakes, crunching three boundaries in one over then smacking him for a big six. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: He looked destined for a 28th Test century but was dismissed lbw to an Anderson ball that pitched up — the English veteran’s first wicket of the tour. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Carey fell soon after for 51, his maiden Test half-century, chipping to Hameed at cover off Anderson. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Temperatures in Adelaide peaked at 37 degrees Celsius (99 Fahrenheit) as England toiled, desperately needing wickets to stay in the game. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: They were rewarded for their persistence by getting not only Labuschagne but Head, who was high on confidence after an impressive 152 in the first Test at Brisbane. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: But he was undone by Root’s part-time spin, with the England captain finding turn and bounce, beating Head with a delivery that left him sprawled on one knee in disbelief, out for 18. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Green only lasted five balls, undone by a fuller delivery from Stokes that clattered into his stumps. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Tailenders Starc and Neser rubbed salt into English wounds in a quickfire 58-run stand before the declaration.

Tag String: LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and all six HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchises have agreed that every team may pick two additional players in the Supplementary Category for the seventh edition of the league, being held from  Jan 27 to Feb 27. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “Although each side can select one foreign player each, the decision opens up opportunities for the local emerging cricketers to experience franchise cricket that will contribute in their grooming and development. Separately, this will also provide extra players to the teams, should they require for reasons beyond their control,” the PCB stated in a press release issued on Friday. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “The teams will pick additional players in the Replac­ement Player Draft, which is expected to take place through a virtual session on Jan 7, 2022. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “Karachi Kings will have the first option to pick the first additional player, followed by Lahore Qalandars, Islamabad United, Quetta Gladiators, Multan Sultans and Peshawar. This order has been decided through a random draw. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “Using the reverse order format, the second picks will be as follows: Peshawar Zalmi, Multan Sultans, Quetta Gladiators, Islamabad United, Lahore Qalandars and Karachi Kings,” the PCB release concluded.

Tag String: The One-day International (ODI) series between West Indies and Pakistan, that was scheduled to begin in Karachi on December 18 (Saturday), has been postponed and rescheduled for early June 2022 after more members of the touring party tested positive for Covid-19 on Wednesday. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String:   
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "On Thursday morning and as part of the PCB's Covid-19 Protocols, rapid antigen tests were conducted on the remaining 15 West Indies players and six player support personnel. All 21 members of the West Indies touring party returned negative test results. As such, Thursday’s T20I proceeded as planned," the statement said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “However, taking into consideration both teams’ welfare, as well as the limited resources in the West Indies side for the ODIs, it has been agreed that the series [...] will be postponed and rescheduled for early June 2022," the statement said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “This will provide West Indies with an equal opportunity to field their best available players for the World Cup qualification matches," it added. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The statement said that the members of the touring team, who had tested negative after Wednesday's PCR and Thursday's rapid antigen tests, would depart from Pakistan after the Karachi T20I. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "Those who have tested positive will complete their isolation in Karachi before their travel arrangements are finalised to allow them to rejoin their families in time for Christmas celebrations," the statement said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The statement added that members of the Pakistan team, who had all tested negative after Wednesday's tests, would also leave the "managed event environment" after the third T20I. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “The CWI would like to thank the PCB for its excellent series arrangements and appreciates its support in rescheduling the ODI series in June 2022," the statement concluded.

Tag String: The surprise announcement came in one line at the bottom of a press release by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) about the Test squad for the upcoming tour of South Africa. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “I was contacted one and a half hours before the selection meeting on the 8th for the Test series and there was no prior communication to me at all,” Kohli told reporters on Wednesday ahead of the team's departure for South Africa, where they will play three Tests and three ODIs. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “Before ending the call I was told that the five selectors had decided that I would not be the ODI captain, to which I replied, 'ok fine',” the 33-year-old said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Kohli will still captain India in the Tests in South Africa but press reports suggested that he had decided to skip the subsequent ODI series in a huff. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: But Kohli denied this, telling reporters on Wednesday that he “was and am available for selection” and hitting out at sections of the media for “writing lies”. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “I was always keen to play,” he said.

Reason is he is unapproachable with rest teamates, demands more leaves as he is new father, wants to quit T20 captain role, yet retain ODI captainship, too many diva demands when you are jot performing as captain. Rohit is simple, has more wins and cups under his belt and extremly easy going with all teammates and approachable.

Sledging is one thing but field behavior, general body language and dealing with opponent team are different things. Kohli crossed the line many times. Even though I like him as a cricketer, the decision of BCCI to sack him as a captain is 100% right. His arrogance and his vile behavior also divided the team.

Tag String: Every player need to be handle differently.
Special players need to be sat down and discuss one problems,and they should be given respect. 
Kohli comes across as a very good person, this was shown after the loos to pakistan. Yes he can be seen on the field as very aggressive. But that brings the best out of him. He has won many matches for india, and he plays for the team. Not like Tendulkar who played for himself  scored a lot of runs, yet lost matches.

The testing kits by international cricket teams are non faulty and shows the results as they are. So ask IK and media why they are doing this injustice to you and Pakistan?

Tag String: Pakistan, ranked 13th, defeated 11th ranked South Korea 1-0 in the 4th Asian Champions Trophy Hockey Tournament here in the Malaysian city of Kuantan. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The only goal of the match came in the last minute. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The goal was scored by Haseem Khan on Pakistan's fourth penalty corner of the match. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Instead of going for a direct shot, Aleem Bilal pushed the ball towards the left side of the goal and Haseem Khan dived to flick the ball in, to give Pakistan a well deserved victory. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Unlike Thursday, when Pakistan lost the opener 2-4 to hosts Malaysia, Pakistan appeared as a well composed outfit from the outset. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: In a high octane encounter, they matched the Koreans in fitness throughout. Although, the 60 minute play saw just one goal but there were plenty of thrills in the game which saw attacking play. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Korea could not capitalise their seven penalty corners, though four of them came in quick succession. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Pakistani rushers Ejaz and Rizwan Senior halted the opponents' penalty corner strikes at the top of the circle, taking them on stick or foot. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: When the Koreans opted for an indirect drill, Pakistani defence was up to the task, with the national team displaying good team work and understanding. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Sunday will see an eagerly awaited encounter of the event as Pakistan takes on its traditional rival India.

Tag String: Pakistan is not the same team as it used to be. Pakistan used to dominate Hockey for a decade. But now ranked 13. Im suprised they won Olympics. Pakistan Hockey league is needed to rise new stars to build up. Same goes for Football, being the biggest sport in the world and Pakistan is still not taking football serious. Make people love the Sport by building football stadiums in every school and Sport Centres. It will benifit Pakistans economy and reputation.

Tag String:

Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Virat Kohli's decision to relinquish the 20-overs captaincy resulted in him being removed as India's one-day skipper as selectors did not want to have two different white-ball captains, Board of Cricket Control of India (BCCI) chief Sourav Ganguly said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The board, which rarely explains even routine decisions, did not even mention Kohli by name in conveying the leadership change in a single sentence at the bottom of a press release announcing the Test squad for the upcoming tour of South Africa. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “The selectors were uncomfortable with the idea of having two captains for white-ball cricket.” India reached the semi-finals of the 50-overs World Cup in 2019 under Kohli but exited from the group stage at this year's Twenty20 World Cup. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: While happy to play under Rohit in the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia next year, Kohli, who remains the Test captain, was keen to lead India in the 50-overs showpiece on home soil in 2023. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “He has done well even as an ODI captain. But it was not going to be easy to have two captains in white-ball cricket with two World Cups in two years,” Ganguly said. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “The selectors felt the team needed one vision and varied styles of captaincy could disrupt the planning,” Ganguly said, adding that he and chief selector Chetan Sharma spoke to Kohli before making the change. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: “We explained the vision to him. He understood the situation and it was only then that Rohit was named the captain of the ODI team.”

Tag String: The Windies will play three Twenty20 and three one-day internationals — all in Karachi — starting on Monday, their first visit since 2018. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: A Pakistani official said a 26-member party had flown to Karachi early on Thursday before being escorted by heavy security to the team hotel. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The series comes three months after New Zealand quit their first tour to Pakistan in 18 years shortly before the opening match was due to start following a security alert. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Pakistani officials were furious with the cancellations, arguing security measures were lock-tight.

Tag String: Pakistan were forced to play their home international matches abroad — mostly in the United Arab Emirates — until 2015 when normal service tentatively resumed. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: This West Indian squad is somewhat understrength, with regulars Evin Lewis, Shimron Hetmyer, Andre Russell and Lendl Simmons all opting out for personal reasons. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Former skipper Jason Holder is being rested, while Fabian Allen and Obed McCoy are out because of injuries. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Last week, captain Kieron Pollard also withdrew through a hamstring injury, leaving the Twenty20 leadership to Nicholas Pooran and ODIs to Shai Hope. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Four players — Akeal Hosein, Sheldon Cottrell, Dominic Drakes and Odean Smith — will join the team later on Thursday. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: The three T20Is are on December 13, 14 and 16, while the ODIs will be on Dec 18, 20 and 22.

Tag String: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on Wednesday named opening batsman Rohit Sharma as the new captain of the national One-day International (ODI) squad. He replaced Virat Kohli, who is now in charge of only the Test unit. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: "The All-India Senior Selection Committee also decided to name Mr Rohit Sharma as the Captain of the ODI and T20I teams going forward," the BCCI tweeted. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String:   
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Sharma, known for his hard-hitting style, made his debut in 2007 for the national team, initially playing only limited-overs cricket before being added to the Test team as well in 2013. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: He has captained Mumbai Indians to victory in the Indian Premier League (IPL) five times. Royal Challengers Bangalore, led by Kohli until his resignation from their captaincy as well, have never won the title. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: After the World Cup, Kohli stepped down as short-format skipper in September, citing his “immense workload”, and has now yielded the ODI captaincy as well. 
Tag Name: p 
Tag String: Many expected Kohli to lead India in the 50-overs World Cup on home soil in 2023 but the board opted for a single white-ball skipper.
